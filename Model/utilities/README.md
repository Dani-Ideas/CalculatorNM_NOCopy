If you are not capable of doing this on your own, I want you to know that you are a shame as a student. I'm getting tired of working like crazy at my university only to later be unable to upload any of my projects because they get copied by useless people like you. I'm fed up. If you keep cheating, I hope you continue, but when you encounter someone who actually did their work, they will destroy you in job opportunities. There are people who didn’t even get into university, and you, who are in one, can’t even do your own work. You disgust me.
